#### Aims:
<p align="center">
	

		This example for AB testing tries to determine whether or not a higher incidence 
		of click through rates is observed in segments of the data based upon their ages. 
		This information could then be used for data driven sales and marketing initiatives, to maximize ROI. 
		The dataset is split into two groups of varying age ranges as well as four age group subsets 
		to examine any CTR relationships as a function of age.
